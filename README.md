# Test Smell Detection using LLM

advanced test smell detection tool that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to detect and refactor test smells in codebases. Using an innovative agent architecture, each agent is fine-tuned for specific test smells—like Eager Test and Resource Optimism—enabling high accuracy and a systematic approach to code quality. Designed for reliability and efficiency, SniffAI outperforms traditional detection tools with its context-driven, AI-enhanced framework.
